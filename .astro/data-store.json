Schools shut down. Classes went online. At first we all thought the lockdown would last a week or two, but days turned into months and like everyone else I was just‚Ä¶ stuck!! I didn‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù meant then.\n\nAs online classes dragged on, the need for a personal device became real. And this time, my parents had no reason to say no üòÇ. I was finally getting my own phone, mostly for studying (but secretly, I had other plans too, hehe).  \n\nThat‚Äôs when I got my first gadget - the **Redmi Note 9 Pro**, an absolute beast at that time. I told myself it was for school, but soon enough, I was running classes in the background while playing games with my friends in the foreground. The camera was somewhat better than some expensive phones my friends had. So I started taking photos, recording videos and slowly without even realizing it I was becoming the photographer guy in my circle.\n\nBut here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: clicking pictures led to editing them and editing them led to storytelling. I discovered apps like **Kinemaster** and **VN Editor** and I loved the process. I‚Äôd open them up after finishing homework - or even during class if I‚Äôm being honest - and just get lost in editing!\n\nWhen the lockdown was finally removed, my family went on a trip. I casually filmed special moments, smiles, laughter, small interactions and later turned all of it into a short film. I showed it to my family, and they were blown away. Their reactions gave me a kind of validation I‚Äôd never felt before.\n\nFrom that point on, it became a hobby. I started uploading my short films to YouTube. That platform became my creative playground. And those videos used to go viral in my city, and 3k-4k views was normal for me. But I got 2 copyright strikes on my channelshit.\n\nThen came lockdown phase two, and I slipped back into my video + gaming routine. I had moved on to class 10 and started dreaming bigger - I wanted to upgrade to **Adobe Premiere Pro** for more professional editing. But for that, I needed a laptop. A proper one. Preferably one that could also run a few games üëÄ  \n**‚ÄúLife me maza nhi rukne ka‚Äù**  \n*(Never stop having fun in life)*\n\nAfter a lot of convincing (and silent promises), my parents finally agreed. I still remember the excitement of unboxing that laptop. It was expensive for me - 16 years guy and as expected, a few relatives made snided remarks:  \n\n> \"What will he even do with this costly laptop? He won‚Äôt study anyway\"  \n\nThat comment cut deep. But I let my actions speak. I studied, I edited, I uploaded‚Äîand when the board results came out, I had scored well and even scored high in my class. That was my reply.  \n\n---\n\n### My First Income as a Freelance Video Editor\n\nAs things opened up post-COVID, my family hosted a thread ceremony. And of course we needed photographers so we hired a team. At the ceremony while everyone else was busy with rituals, I found myself sitting beside him‚Äîcurious and chatty.\n\nI asked about his career, tips on shooting better videos, and casually, I showed him some of my edits. He was genuinely impressed.  \n\n> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you start working professionally?‚Äù  \n\nI laughed and replied I was still in school. I told him I didn‚Äôt know where to begin. I didn‚Äôt have any network, no clients. That‚Äôs when he offered me a chance.  \n\n> ‚ÄúYou can edit my videos.‚Äù  \n\nAnd just like that, my freelancing journey began.  \n\nI was now in 11th grade, juggling PCM with video editing gigs. While others around me were just scrolling through Instagram or Netflix-watching shows, I was studying maths and making real money from my skills. I remember doing the math one day: I had earned close to ‚Çπ1.2 lakh in a year - almost 150x what I used to get as pocket money. Repaid my laptop price to my father!  \n\nThat phase taught me **discipline, client communication, and a lot about trust**.  \n\n---\n\n### When Trust Turned into Betrayal\n\nOver time, the photographer and I had built a good working relationship‚Ä¶. I delivered projects on time, even trusted him with delayed payments. But one day, things changed.  \n\nI delivered a project worth around ‚Çπ10,000 and he ghosted me. No messages. No calls returned‚Ä¶ I reached out multiple times but never heard back.  \n\nI was disappointed. Not because of the money, but because it was my first brush with betrayal in the real world. Maybe I had to learn this lesson early.  \n\n**Everything happens for a reason.** And this one taught me that trust in freelancing should always come with boundaries.  \n\n---\n\n### Where Passion for Coding Began\n\nAs I entered 12th grade, like most students, I was focused on just one thing: cracking JEE. I had enrolled in the Physics Wallah online batch, prepared my schedule, and trained myself for one of the most competitive exams in India.  \n\nAt the same time, I had taken **Computer Science (Python)** as an optional subject, along with PCM. Truth be told, I hadn‚Äôt studied CS much in 11th, so I was already feeling behind. One day, while sitting in English class with my friend Asad, we were casually talking about CS and how lost we both felt.  \n\nThat‚Äôs when he said,  \n\n> ‚ÄúLet me ask my elder brother! He can teach us.‚Äù  \n\nAnd that one small conversation changed everything.  \n\n---\n\n### Enter Hussain Nagaria - the person we all lovingly call Hussain Bhaiya\n\nThe Spark  \nWe started learning Python from him - me, Asad, and a few more close friends. His way of teaching was calm, clear, and super friendly‚Ä¶ We didn‚Äôt feel like students attending a boring tuition class. It felt like a bunch of curious kids learning something exciting every weekend.  \n\nWe used to visit his house on Saturdays and Sundays, learning Python while enjoying the vibe. On weekdays I‚Äôd switch back into JEE mode > solving problems, chasing rank, balancing it all.  \n\nAnd somewhere in between those weekends, I felt something change. I wasn‚Äôt just learning Python...  \nI was falling in love with code.  \n\n---\n\n### My First Teaching Experience\n\nThen came Teacher‚Äôs Day - a day I‚Äôll always remember.  \n\nThere was a competition where seniors had to go teach juniors. We were judged on clarity, student engagement, silence in class, and way of teaching.  \n\nI walked into that classroom and taught Python basics, logic building, fun examples and suddenly, the juniors weren‚Äôt just listening, they were excited. Asking questions. Staying curious.  \n\nAt the end of the day, I won **Gold for \"Best Student Teacher\"**.  \n\nThat was the moment I realized :) I don‚Äôt just enjoy coding... I enjoy teaching it too.  \n\n---\n\n### Reality Check\n\nWhen boards ended, I had scored the highest in CS in my class. Huge thanks to Hussain Bhaiya for that.  \n\nBut on the JEE side... it didn‚Äôt go as planned. I had only barely qualified. After months of preparation, sleepless nights, and hard work - no selection. That broke me.  \n\nI stopped talking much. I was considering a drop year. Quietly, I was slipping into self-doubt.  \n\nBut like always, Hussain Bhaiya checked in as he knew my coding skills. He was just asking:  \n\n> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù  \n\nI just replied,  \n\n> ‚ÄúDrop.‚Äù  \n\nHe didn‚Äôt say anything for a second. Then he said,  \n\n> ‚ÄúCome over to my place. We‚Äôll talk.‚Äù  \n\n---\n\n### That One Night Changed Everything\n\nWhen I reached his house that evening, I was carrying zero expectations. Just disappointment.  \n\nWe talked for hours. He opened up about his own journey and how he had taken a drop, cleared JEE Advanced later, but still didn‚Äôt go to an NIT/IIT due to personal choices. And yet, despite everything, he landed his first job while still in his second year of online bachelors.  \n\nHe looked at me and said,  \n\n> ‚ÄúJEE didn‚Äôt go well, but your journey doesn‚Äôt end here. It‚Äôs only the beginning..‚Äù  \n\nThat night, we mapped out my career roadmap: coding, freelancing, real-world learning. A different path. A bold one. But one that felt right.  \n\nAnd for the first time in a long while, I slept peacefully.  \n\n---\n\n### Stepping Into the Real World of Code\n\nI took admission at **Chhattisgarh Institute of Technology (CGIT)** in my hometown. While my college taught the basics, I turned to **Udemy, Coursera, YouTube, and Google** for everything else. I entered college carrying one heavy thought:  \n\n*\"I messed up JEE.\"*  \n\nIt felt like I'd already lost before the race even began.  \n\nOne day, Hussain Bhaiya gave me the book **_The Power of Positive Attitude_**, and it completely changed the way I thought about everything. That‚Äôs when I discovered the power of reading self-help books. I started reading more books focused on positive thinking, life lessons, and finance.  \n\nAt that time, I had no friends left in my hometown - everyone had moved out for their studies so I was the only one left in my group. (I had friends at that time but no jigrii yaar)  \n\nSo I made a deal with myself: No matter how behind I felt. No matter how tough it got. I would believe in myself and do the work.  \n\nWeek after week, I kept learning. Slowly, piece by piece, I built confidence.  \n\nThat‚Äôs when I discovered **Django**. I fell in love with the framework‚Äôs clarity and power. Within just 8 months, I built my first real-world project - an e-commerce platform where users could register, buy/sell products, and manage inventory.  \n\nI showed the project to Bhaiya. He nodded and said,  \n\n> ‚ÄúNow you're ready.‚Äù  \n\nDuring that learning journey, something else happened that I didn‚Äôt expect - I started helping others on **LinkedIn**. I shared daily learnings, Python tricks, project updates - anything I was exploring. Newcomers started reaching out. I had unknowingly built a small community. A following, even. And that felt even more special for me!  \n\n---\n\n### Now It Was Time to Face the Real World‚Ä¶\n\nAfter months of learning and building, Hussain Bhaiya introduced me to something new - the **Frappe Framework**.  \n\nAs he was working at Frappe, he told me,  \n\n> \"There‚Äôs a huge shortage of skilled Frappe developers. Learn it. Contribute. The opportunities are wide open.\"  \n\nI was excited. But once I got into it... I‚Äôll be honest - I felt completely lost.  \n\nThere were too many Doctypes, too many linked fields, and too much happening behind the scenes. Coming from a Django background, where everything was structured and the community was massive, this felt like being thrown into the deep end without a map.  \n\nI still remember thinking every time Hussain Bhaiya praised the \"beauty\" of Frappe :)  \n\n> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the magic here? I don‚Äôt see it.‚Äù  \n\nBut I kept learning. I kept building.  \n\nThen came a turning point - I created an **Airport Management App using Frappe** and shared it on LinkedIn.  \n\nThat night, I went to sleep, not expecting anything at all.  \n\nThe next morning, something unbelievable happened. Very few people get this type of opportunity.  \n\n> *(Pursue excellence and success will come chasing you)*  \n\nI woke up to a message that read:  \n\n> ‚ÄúAre you looking for a job?‚Äù  \n\nIt was from **Chinmay Kulkarni, the CEO of Hybrowlabs Technologies**.  \n\nI replied, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù He asked for my contact information. We got on a call. I shared my journey, showed him the projects I‚Äôd built so far, and told him about how I started with zero experience.  \n\nHe listened carefully, then said something I‚Äôll never forget:  \n\n> \"You remind me of myself. You're doing great for someone in their first year of college. I‚Äôd love to support that energy and young minds.\"  \n\nThat same day, he offered me an internship.  \n\nToday, it‚Äôs been **5 months** since I joined **Hybrowlabs Technologies, Pune**, as a software developer intern.  \n\nI want to take this moment to say thank you, **Chinmay**, for believing in a beginner. For giving me a space to grow.  \n\nAnd above all, a huge thank you to **Hussain Bhaiya, Founder of BWH Studios**, for every blocker I faced, every time I doubted myself, and every time I was about to quit but he was there. Guiding me. Pushing me. Believing in me.  \n\nThis is where all the hard work started to pay off. But this is **not the end**. It‚Äôs just the beginning‚Ä¶  \n\n---\n\n### Lessons I‚Äôve Learned\n\n*\"With the right guidance and relentless effort, you can achieve in months what might otherwise take years.\"*  \n\nHard work matters, but direction matters just as much. Speed without direction is chaos. True velocity comes when you combine both ‚Äì magnitude + direction.  \n\nI‚Äôve seen this first-hand. Hussain Bhaiya spent two years mastering what he now teaches. By learning from his journey and avoiding the mistakes he made, I was able to walk the same path in just eight/nine months.  \n\nThat‚Äôs the power of mentorship, of learning from others, and of being willing to put in the work. When you have the right guide and the discipline to follow through, nothing can stop you from reaching your goals faster ‚Äì and with purpose.  \n\n---\n\n### Next Short Term Goal\n\nDuring all this, I also missed the chance to intern at **DRDO**, the most prestigious defence organization.  \n\nI developed a love for **open source** while working on the Linux operating system and the Frappe framework. My next aspiration is to contribute to open source and gain experience working at DRDO.  \n\nI‚Äôll share more about this in my upcoming blog - **stay tuned**.","src/content/blog/my-journey.md",[34],"../../assets/my-journey.jpeg","745b303f2fcc7c9c","new-start",{"id":36,"data":38,"body":40,"filePath":41,"assetImports":42,"digest":43},{"title":27,"description":28,"pubDate":39,"heroImage":30},["Date","2025-07-31T18:30:00.000Z"],"## hii","src/content/blog/new-start.md",[34],"364952b764658611"]
